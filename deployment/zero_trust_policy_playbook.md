# Zero Trust Policy Engine Deployment Playbook

## Overview
This playbook guides you through deploying the Zero Trust Policy Engine, a Python/Flask microservice that enforces JWT-based authentication and role-based access control (RBAC/ABAC).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- PyJWT
- Docker (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or copy the `zero_trust_policy.py` file.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask pyjwt
   ```
3. Set environment variable for secret key:
   ```bash
   export SECRET='your-secure-secret'
   ```
4. Run the service:
   ```bash
   python zero_trust_policy.py
   ```

## Configuration

- Update the `SECRET` key to a strong, secure value.
- Integrate with your identity provider to issue JWT tokens.
- Extend RBAC/ABAC logic in the `/resource` endpoint as needed.

## Deployment

- Use Docker for containerized deployment:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.9-slim
  COPY zero_trust_policy.py /app/
  WORKDIR /app
  RUN pip install flask pyjwt
  ENV SECRET=your-secure-secret
  CMD ["python", "zero_trust_policy.py"]
  ```
- Deploy on Kubernetes or cloud services with environment variables securely managed.

## Monitoring & Logging

- Enable Flask logging for audit trails.
- Integrate with SIEM for real-time alerting.

## Security Best Practices

- Rotate secrets regularly.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Limit token lifetimes and enforce refresh policies.
