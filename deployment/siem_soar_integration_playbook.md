# SIEM/SOAR Integration Deployment Playbook

## Overview
This playbook guides you through integrating your privacy defense logs with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms for real-time monitoring and alerting.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Access to your SIEM server (e.g., Splunk, ELK, QRadar)
- Network connectivity to SIEM syslog endpoint

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or copy the `log_forwarder.py` script.
2. Configure the SIEM server address and port in the script.
3. Install dependencies if needed.

## Usage

Run the log forwarder script:

```bash
python log_forwarder.py
```

It will forward logs to your SIEM server via syslog.

## Configuration

- Adjust logging levels and formats as per your SIEM requirements.
- Secure the communication channel (e.g., TLS) if supported.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review SIEM alerts and dashboards.
- Integrate with SOAR for automated incident response.
- Maintain log retention policies compliant with regulations.
